# A Yen for the Future
Time-Series Forecasting and Linear Regression Modelling are used to predict future movemnts in the value of the Canadian dollar verses the Japanese yen.

## Background

This Python-written project utilizes Time Series analysis, along with a Linear Regression model, to forecast the price of the Candian dollar verses the Japanese yen. ARMA, ARIMA, and GARCH forecasting models included, as well as decomposition using the Hodrick-Prescott filter. In-Sample and Out-of-Sample performance metrics used to evaluate Linear Regression model.
